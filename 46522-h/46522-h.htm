cloth 60c. (20c.) means 40 cents net to Stockholders. To avoid possible misunderstanding,
orders at <i><b>Stockholders&rsquo; prices</b> must invariably</i> be accompanied by remittance,

<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<h2 id="c1"><br />Co-operative Publishing.</h2>
<p><span class="sc">The Alden Publishing Co.</span> was organized June 1888 with a view, on the part of its
promoters, to consolidating and strengthening various interests which had previously been
allied, but independent, and of introducing to the fullest practicable extent the principle of
<i>co-operation</i> for the <i>benefit of buyers</i> of books. The amount of capital paid
up Feb. 4, 1889, was $61,167.00. A dividend of <i>five per cent.</i> was paid Dec. 20,
1888. The business is recently growing very rapidly, and the prospects are extremely encouraging.</p>
<h3 title="">The Alden Publishing Co.</h3>
<p>The Company was incorporated June, 1888; authorized capital $500,000: shares $1.00
each. The capital stock of the Company is sold at par for cash, in lots of not less than five shares, and
is <i>NOT</i> assessible, and there is absolutely no liability to stockholders whose shares are fully paid for, under
any circumstances, other than the liability for salaries of employes, which is common to, we believe, all of
the States, and is practically no liability, salaries being paid weekly or fortnightly.</p>
<p><i>All dividends</i> will be paid <i>in cash</i>, but each Stockholder will be allowed the
privilege of taking instead of cash any books sold by the Company to the amount of the dividend, at
special reduced prices to stockholders, which makes the dividend <i>equivalent to about 16 per cent</i>.
<i>Prices to Stockholders</i> are the regular prices <i>reduced</i> by the amount indicated by the figures in
parenthesis immediately following the Catalogue price.</p>
<p>Stockholders have the privilege of purchasing at any time any books sold by the
Company at a small advance upon the cost, this privilege being limited in amount to a sum not exceeding,
in any one year, the par value of the Stock owned by the purchaser. For prices to stockholders,
see catalogue.</p>
<p>Some limitation is, obviously, necessary; otherwise any one at enmity with the enterprise, might, on an
investment of $10.00, purchase an unlimited quantity of books at reduced prices, and undersell us with
our own customers. The privilege is open to Stockholders immediately upon investment being made.</p>
<p>What lover of good books can not afford to take at least <i>ten shares</i>? How many
friends might, with advantage, take a hundred, or more shares? A million dollars capital would
not suffice to manufacture the books our patrons are urgently calling for: we are doing now an immense
business for the amount of our capital, which business will be increased as our resources are enlarged.</p>
<p class="center"><b>76 Per Cent. Annual Dividends!</b></p>
<p><i>The Literary Revolution</i> has never assumed to furnish books at a price below
what would permit a fair profit, nor has it ever solicited investments on the basis of expectation of fabulous
returns. The facts are simple, and the opportunities offered are based on common sense. If you
invest $10.00 you have reasonable expectation of not less than 10 per cent. annual dividend, but as a Stockholder
you also have the opportunity of purchasing with your dividend books at a price below what they
would cost one <i>NOT</i> a Stockholder&mdash;that makes your dividend equal to about <i>16 per cent</i>. Again, you, as
a Stockholder, are allowed the opportunity of purchasing, <i>if you want them</i>, during each year, books at
<i>special prices</i> to an amount not greater than the par value of your Stock which, as will be seen from
the list of prices to Stockholders, average (on our own publications) about <i>40 per cent.</i> below what the
same books would cost one not a Stockholder. In other words, you can buy $16.00 worth of books for
about $10.00, thus saving $6.00, which is equal to 60 per cent. on your $10.00 stock, which, added to 16 per
cent. dividend, makes practically <i>76 per cent.</i> per annum on your investment. If you own $100.00 or
more Stock you have similar privileges to the larger amount&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t want so many books for your
own use you can accommodate your friends or you can sell the books at a profit.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Literary Revolution Savings-Bonds.</b></p>
<p>To meet the convenience of friends of the enterprise who hesitate to make an investment of a character
so permanent as in the Capital Stock of the Company, a <i>Savings-Bond</i> is now issued, payable three
months, six months or twelve months from its date, which affords every facility given by the ownership of
Stock, but pays approximately <i>60 per cent.</i> per annum, instead of 76 per cent. A copy of the Bond, elsewhere,
gives full particulars.</p>

of the writers, which gives the reader a good idea of their qualities.
For a great multitude of readers the volume is just such a book as they
need.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Inter-Ocean</i>, Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently Prof. Hutson is an accomplished scholar and a thorough
master of the subject of which he writes. His book is as fresh and bright
and interesting as a novel.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>News</i>, Charleston, S. C.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A short history of French literature, clear, comprehensive, well arranged,
extending from its beginnings to the present time; the interest is
enhanced by the personality with which the author invests the individual
writers, and by the well-chosen quotations (translated) with which he sustains
his own opinions.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Leader</i>, Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A handsome manual by Professor C. W. Hutson, author of &lsquo;The Beginnings
of Civilization.&rsquo; It is marked by the same scholarly spirit as was
there shown. It covers the last 900 years in its view. The troubadours,
the fables and the chronicles, the Renaissance ages, the great satirists, dramatists,
essayists, encyclopedists, the scientific writers, the philosophers, the
critics and the poets, men and women, from Moliere to de Stael, and even
the translated French literature of Louisiana&mdash;all are generously though
compactly treated.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</i>, Brooklyn, N. Y.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work is exceedingly interesting, and gives a very faithful illustration
of French thought as set forth in the general literature of the
people. One cannot read the work without securing a fair and most pleasant
acquaintance with the eminent men and women who have given to
France a literature second to none, in many respects, of any nation. The
author shows himself both an admirer of French thought and thoroughly
conversant with it.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Herald of Gospel Liberty</i>, Dayton, Ohio.</p>

Is made of perfectly kiln-dried cherry birch, with birds-eye maple panels; hand carved; built on
ingenious but simple interlocking principles, doing away, mainly, with screws, nails or glue; may

</dl>
<p>Alden&rsquo;s &ldquo;New&rdquo; Ideal Revolving Book Case, above described, ready
May 1, 1889, is a great improvement upon the styles heretofore sold. The
new is supported from the top instead of at the base, as formerly, thus
standing firmer and revolving more freely; the &ldquo;knock-down&rdquo; feature of
No. 3 is a triumph of mechanical ingenuity; the workmanship and the
material used, in both styles, are a great advance on those formerly sold&mdash;this
is high praise, indeed, considering the delightful satisfaction the book

<dl class="detail"><dt><b>Daudet. The Immortal.</b> By Alphonse Daudet. 12mo, cloth, <b>60c.</b> (20c)</dt>
</dl>
<p>&ldquo;Daudet is undoubtedly a genius. He knows the power of words, and
uses it with skill. The simplest scenes fairly thrill with life. His noble
characters move with that charm that is so attractive, and his ignoble characters
with that meanness that is so detestable. When he touches with that
genuine simplicity any bewitching look of nature, he makes it so powerful
that it remains in the memory long afterwards. Whether this last novel
of the great Frenchman is aimed or not at the individual members of the
Academy, we do not know, but certainly he punctures the big bubble of
the Academy itself and lets out a great deal of the gas; not in one place or
two, but in a hundred. But we sincerely wish this literary French genius
would employ his pen with less objection in some instances, or, in other
words, that he would be more chaste and refined. If this is a study of social
life, as he claims in his dedication, then evidently what Paris needs is not
so much study, but reform.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Zion&rsquo;s Herald</i>, Boston.</p>

<h3 id="c141">The Gospel Story.</h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>Pittenger. The Interwoven Gospels.</b> The four histories of Jesus Christ blended into a complete and
continuous narrative in the words of the Gospels. According to the American Revised Version of
1881. Compiled by Rev. William Pittenger. 12mo, cloth, with maps, <b>90c.</b> (30c)</dt>
</dl>
<p>In this ingenious work the four biographies of Christ are given in the
language of the Gospels, but so arranged and blended as to form one continuous narrative.
When known, the period and place at which the events described occurred are noted.
Where the Evangelists have given more than one account, the fullest one, or the one which
best harmonized with the preceding subject, has been taken and the peculiarities of the
others interwoven therewith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work is well done, and will be welcome aid to many in the study
of the New Testament.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Examiner</i>, N. Y. City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pittenger has done his work skillfully and the book cannot but
prove helpful to the Bible student.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Witness</i>, Montreal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a useful and important work for Sunday-Schools and Bible classes
engaged in the study of the Word.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Western Christian Advocate</i>, Cincinnati.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Interwoven Gospels is an exceedingly helpful and convenient
arrangement, based on a good plan, and well wrought.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Rev. Richard G. Greene</span>,
East Orange, N. J.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work supplies an arrangement that most readers feel the need of,
for obvious reasons, and is very useful as an introduction to study of the New Testament.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Globe</i>, Boston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The advantage of such a book, both to a young reader and to a teacher
of New Testament history, in bringing the gospel narratives into their proper relations,
and in giving a clear mental view of the times and seasons to which events belong, must
be apparent,&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Interior</i>, Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The author has made the Gospels (in the language of the Gospels) an
easy and finished biography of Jesus Christ, and offers a book to the Bible student second
to none other on the life and works of Christ. It is worthy of room in every family and
Sunday-School library.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Express</i>, Easton, Pa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If put into the hand of a child as his first introduction to the study of
the New Testament, it will be read as an ordinary connected history; and when the Gospels
in their common form are afterward read, the relation of their different parts will be at
once understood, and many otherwise perplexing questions may never even arise.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Church Year</i>, Jacksonville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a Harmony, in the general sense of the term. Though in the
general line of helps in the study of the Evangelical Narrative, it is something more practical,
more living, and shows &lsquo;the mark of the tool&rsquo; less than any Harmony we are acquainted
with. This, we believe, can be read, and may be used intelligently in the study
of The Word. It should find its way into the libraries of our pastors and Sunday-School
teachers.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Guardian</i>, Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The task, which the title indicates, is not as easy as might be at first
sight supposed. The passages referring to a particular incident have not to be merely
pitched into a common pile, but built into a symmetrical structure; and some of the faults
which the compiler has to avoid are the impairing of the authority of the Gospel narrative
by the addition of many words; the sense of incompleteness caused by omissions, and the
disadvantages of references too many and references too few. The plan which Mr. Pittenger
has adopted appears to obviate many of these difficulties.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Globe</i>, Toronto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have wisely chosen the Revised Version with the American
Readings incorporated in the text. The arrangement is in harmony with the best results
of chronological study, and the most natural. The blending of particular accounts shows
good judgment, in the selection of one as a standard, and filling up the narrative from the
others. In performing this delicate task the golden mean has been quite nearly reached, of
not doing too little or too much. For consecutive reading by either old or young and for
general and popular use, I regard your work as the best now before the public.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">G. W. Clark, D.D.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;One of those companionable books that have almost a personality for

<p>&ldquo;The writer has a genuine instinct for the now almost lost art of essay
writing. His quiet humor, now and then turned by a clever stroke of wit
and well-pointed epigram, and his easy colloquial style, make the reading
of his breezy and interesting volume uncommonly entertaining.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Saturday
Evening Gazette</i>, Boston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The essays forming the volume show in the writer wide and careful
reading, and a memory stored with the fruits of literary research, with a
happy facility in imparting what he has acquired. His humor is delicate
and mirth-provoking, his illustration of the sentiments presented and positions
taken are apposite and pointed, and the serious practical teachings
scattered throughout the book are calculated to leave wholesome impressions
upon the thoughtful reader.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Freeman</i>, Kingston, N. Y.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The contents consists of a collection of essays having no essential relation

attractive style.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Times</i>, Troy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the brightest of the young American writers, although but a recent
adventurer in the field of authorship, is Harold Van Santvoord....
His most ambitious attempt, and his most successful, we sincerely hope, is
now before us in the volume entitled, &lsquo;Half-Holiday; Elysian Dreams and
Sober Realities.&rsquo; While not flippant Mr. Van Santvoord is essentially a
humorist, and his humor is of the American school so often analyzed by the
critics. But unlike most of our native humorists he is scholarly, and even
his sprightliest passages reveal evidence of wide reading.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Argus</i>, Albany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Half-Holidays&rsquo; is a collection of short essays on such subjects as &lsquo;Are
Parsons Great Eaters,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Hospitality of Solitude,&rsquo; &lsquo;Sermons in Hot
Weather,&rsquo; &lsquo;Lost Books,&rsquo; &lsquo;Music and Madness,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Poetry of Flowers,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;The Significance of a Single Word.&rsquo; They are after-dinner papers,
bright and lively in their treatment; they make no serious demand on one&rsquo;s
thought, and yet are suggestive of much that is wise in the philosophy of
life, and deal lightly and gracefully with the odds and ends of everyday
existence. They remind one of Lamb&rsquo;s &lsquo;Essays of Elia.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Herald</i>, Boston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One reads this collection of short and bright essays with a feeling that
they were written with more than the ordinary delight of an author. They
are spontaneous recitals of an imaginative mind&rsquo;s observations and
dreams. It occurs to us, as we read, that it would be a suggestive companion
for persons&mdash;notably the younger generation&mdash;who find it hard to converse,
growing up to realize that it is necessary to say something, but at a
loss what to talk about.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>School Journal</i>, New York.</p>

and an introduction by N. P. Willis. 12mo, 481 pages. Long Primer type, cloth, <b>50c.</b> (20c)</dt>
</dl>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most famous books of travel ever printed in this country.
The book is less known to readers of this generation than it should be, and we advise those
who are not acquainted with its charm to adopt this opportunity of making its acquaintance.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian
Union</i>, New York City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Views Afoot is a book of travel which is nearly as interesting now, as
when it first appeared over forty years ago. Taylor was a splendid sight-seer and a rare
recounter of his experiences. This new edition is one of Alden&rsquo;s efforts to bring good literature
within the reach of the poorest reader.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Interior</i>, Chicago, Ill.</p>
<h3 id="c148">Views Afoot.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Bayard Taylor&rsquo;s Views Afoot will long continue to be one of the few
books of European travel which people will delight to read. There is a charm in the
author&rsquo;s style, conjoined with remarkable power of description. The novelty of his traveling
on the continent on foot, with staff and knapsack, visiting places much out of the way,
seeing the people and living amongst them&mdash;all this makes the book a <i>rara avis</i> among
books of travel.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Guardian</i>, Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the works of this distinguished author, perhaps no one has more
freshness and enthusiasm than this. We have the ardor and the quick insight of the afterwards
world-renowned poet and author of books of travel, etc., in the bud of promise.
Certainly the volume is very readable.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Star</i>, Boston, Mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We remember with what exquisite pleasure, in our college days, we
read this charmingly-written story of a jaunt a-foot. It was so full of life and happiness,
good-will and abounding health. This new edition does not dim these excellences at all,
and he who especially enjoys reading books of travel will not read another until he has
gone through these fascinating pages. How cheap this edition is&mdash;only 50 cents. Give it
to some travel-mania friend.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Zion&rsquo;s Herald</i>, Boston, Mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John B. Alden has put the reading public under renewed obligation
by publishing a cheap edition of Bayard Taylor&rsquo;s &lsquo;Views Afoot.&rsquo; These chapters delighted
the last generation, and they still have their power to charm and instruct.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian
Standard</i>, Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
<h3 id="c149">Europe <span class="small">SEEN WITH</span> Knapsack and Staff.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;A poor boy, with no literary reputation, he sets out to traverse the
countries of Europe on foot. It was the beginning of an extraordinary career as a writer,
traveler and lecturer. Others have since followed in his footsteps, but none has ever been
able to surpass Bayard Taylor in originality of observation, in perspicacity of style, or
variety of experiences. It is Europe brought to our own doors.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Journal and Messenger</i>,
Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A book well worth reprinting in attractive but inexpensive style. More
than any other, it laid the foundation of Bayard Taylor&rsquo;s reputation as a traveller and
writer. These chapters are written in a style of charming na&iuml;vet&eacute; and freshness, giving
the reader not the hackneyed views of an experienced and often cynical traveller, but the
fresh enthusiasm of a generous, eager youth, visiting for the first time the countries of
which he had long dreamed. In this respect this earlier book possesses charms which are
denied the later volumes by the same author. One of the incidental but very real advantages
of this book is to show on what a very small capital (Bayard Taylor started with only
$140), a resolute, plucky American youth can spend two years in foreign travel, if he is
willing to undergo some privations and hardships. It is a narrative of grit, pluck and endurance
as well as of foreign travel. What was done in 1844 can be done in 1889 if one is
equipped with the same fortitude and courage.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Golden Rule</i>, Boston, Mass.</p>

fall from the lips of venerable sages. No less practicable would it be

<h3 id="c153">A Grand Book <span class="smaller">FOR THE SONS OF</span> The Grand Army.</h3>
<p>A large portion of the narrative and historical literature of the great civil war has a profound
interest for every patriot as well as for every soldier. It tells of noble deeds performed
by heroic men and furnishes us with some of the most sublime instances of bravery
and fidelity of which there is either record or tradition. Among the books belonging to
this class is one which is unique in its character, intense in its interest, and which stands
in the front rank of works relating to the war. In a vivid manner it describes the inception
and incidents of that most daring and brilliant exploit known as</p>
<h3 id="c154">The Great Locomotive Chase.</h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>Daring and Suffering.</b> A history of the great Raid and Locomotive chase in Georgia in 1862. By <span class="sc">William

<dt>&mdash;The same, cheap ed., the story complete but omitting documents, paper, <b>40c.</b>; cloth, <b>75c.</b>, post-paid.</dt>
</dl>
<p>&ldquo;The story of the Andrews Railroad Raid must always be one of the most picturesque,
thrilling and moving episodes of the rebellion, and though the facts were made public
many years ago by the author of the work before us, this exhaustive, revised and expanded
narrative, will be received with the hearty welcome it deserves. &lsquo;Daring and Suffering&rsquo;
is indeed a remarkable book, not only for its matter, but for the manner of its recital. It
deserves to take its place with the most notable histories of imprisonment and escape.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Tribune</i>,
N. Y. City.</p>
<p class="center"><b>A DARING ENTERPRISE.</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;Every reader will agree with Gen. Joseph Holt that the expedition, in the daring
of its conception, had the wildness of romance, &lsquo;while in the gigantic and overwhelming
results it sought to obtain it was absolutely sublime.&rsquo; An Atlanta paper said of
the affair, a few days after its failure, that it was &lsquo;the deepest laid scheme, and on the
grandest scale, that ever emanated from the brains of any number of Yankees combined.&rsquo;
Count de Paris says in his history of the civil war in America that, &lsquo;despite
its tragic termination, it shows what a handful of brave men could undertake in
America.&rsquo; In truth, there is no parallel in history to this undertaking of Andrews in
an enemy&rsquo;s country.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Commercial Gazette</i>, Cincinnati, O.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a narrative of one of the wildest and most thrilling adventures of the war.&rdquo;
<i>The Evening Post</i>, N. Y. City.</p>
<p class="center"><b>A VIVID PRESENTATION.</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;The realism of the author reminds one of Tolstoi and his military pictures in the
forms of both history and romance.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Eagle</i>, Brooklyn, N. Y.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So thrillingly and graphically told that the readers pulses tingle as his fancy
accompanies this wild expedition.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Courier</i>, Buffalo, N. Y.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A vivid and authentic account of Andrews&rsquo; railroad raid&mdash;a most daring adventure.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
News</i>, Chicago.</p>
<p class="center"><b>THE SONS OF VETERANS</b></p>
<p>and, indeed, every American, young or old, should read this record of an heroic effort
and the failure of a brilliant enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Daring and Suffering&rsquo; should be read by every American boy that he may see
what deeds of daring Americans will do for love of country.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Republican</i>, Washington,
D. C.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This expedition has been so nearly forgotten that the public ought to be under
great obligations to Mr. Pittenger for recording at length the bravery and endurance
of those who participated in it. While such men exist the republic may never fear for
its safety.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Sun</i>, N. Y. City.</p>
<p class="center"><b>A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE RECORD.</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;The author has consulted every available source of information, has gone repeatedly
over the ground, explored the Government archives at Washington and files of Confederate
newspapers, and obtained the assistance of survivors on both sides of the
struggle. He is thus able to present a vivid, impartial and perfectly authenticated picture
of the most romantic event of the civil war, the full story of which has never before
been told.&rdquo; The illustrations also add greatly to the interest and value of the work.</p>

<p>The only edition embodying the full performances of and fairly exhibiting Goldsmith
genius. Contains many and valuable additions to collections previously issued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goldsmith, both in verse and prose, was one of the most delightful writers in the
language. His verse flows like a limpid stream. His ease is quite unconscious. Everything
in him is spontaneous, unstudied, unaffected, yet elegant, harmonious, graceful, and
nearly faultless.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Hazlitt.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Traveller&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Deserted Village&rsquo; scarcely claim any notice from me. They

<p>&ldquo;Sir, it is the great excellence of a writer to put into his book as much as his book will

<p>&ldquo;No man can claim to be thoroughly posted on English history unless he has read
Green. The enthusiasm and painstaking accuracy of the author, and the luminous style in
which he writes, stamp the history as a classic. Every man who has Anglo-Saxon blood in

<p>&ldquo;Is recognized by scholars as the best complete modern History of England in existence.
Its finish of style removes it from the catalogue of books of reference, and makes the study

<p>&ldquo;Green&rsquo;s History is one of the most brilliant and thoroughly valuable historical
works which has appeared in many years. Fairly ranking with Macaulay&rsquo;s great work

in that it covers the entire period of English history from the earliest to modern times,

</dl>
<p>&ldquo;It is a satire on the famous company of the &lsquo;Immortals,&rsquo; and any one
who reads it, will discover the peculiar talents of the author. He has a
very retentive memory, and extraordinary powers of description. He gives
to his heroes and heroines a life-like reality, so that the reader is carried
right on into the turmoil of their existence. Daudet makes his characters
perform the most merciless and pitiless actions, and his powers of description
are so vivid, that the reader moves on with it all, in spite of himself.
Get a copy of the book and test the truth of this assertion.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The School

genius; he dips his pen, not in malice, but in a literary inspiration which
delights all Europe and America.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Church Year</i>, Jacksonville, Fla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book is a fierce onslaught on the French Academy, but exhibits the

<p>&ldquo;This thrilling Cossack tale is put into English by Jeremiah Curtin,
with a &lsquo;dedication&rsquo; to Hon. Andrew G. Curtin, in which is set forth the
fact (as shown by correspondence between Napoleon III. and Alexander II.)
that France and England had agreed to recognize the Southern Confederacy,
and were only kept from it by Russia&rsquo;s friendliness to us. The preface by
the translator, too, is full of historic interest, preparing the reader to understand
the story of old Taras.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Standard</i>, Cincinnati.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although the reader may not admire all the traits of character of old
Taras Bulba, he will become so interested in the story at the very beginning
that he will not be willing to lay the book down until completed. The
whole volume is so full of valuable information that no one can afford not
to read it.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Democrat</i>, Madison, Wis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A more romantic and profoundly interesting recital has not come to
our notice that involved Russian politics and character and Polish patriotism
and devotion. Gogol is entitled by this work to rank with Turgenieff,
and while he is not the philosopher that Tolstoi is, nor a man of such learning,
he is worthy to be his contemporary and is equally graceful and vigorous
in his style.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Record-Union</i>, Sacramento, Cal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This singular story is full of graphic touches. Now they paint the
squalor of the Jews&rsquo; quarter in Warsaw, now the fierce combat of half
savage men, now the flower-strewn steppes, and now the deepest, tenderest
passion of the human heart. The translator does not exaggerate in his
praise of Gogol&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Cynosure</i>, Chicago.</p>

<h3 id="c161">CIVILIZATION.</h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>The Beginnings of Civilization.</b> By Prof. Charles Woodward Hutson. Ideal Ed., cl., <b>60c.</b> (20c);</dt>
</dl>
<p>&ldquo;To-day the secrets of prehistoric humanity lie beneath the surfaces of
language and arch&aelig;ology. We gaze into the depths and see the objects
lying along the bottom, but we do not all see alike. Perhaps we are not
yet acquainted with the media through which we look. Whether we are
contented or not to take as final the present conclusions of any one of the
various schools of arch&aelig;ologists, it remains that the facts or data are intensely
interesting. Touching the origin of man, it is probable that we shall
never be able to determine from the Bible or from ethnology whether all
men sprang from one pair or from many; and salvation does not depend
upon a decision. Whether, with the Duke of Argyll, we believe humanity
to have retrogressed as a result of the Fall: whether with the Jews of the
Talmud and Book of Zohar, we suppose that man was created first as a
beast, and after ages received the spirit by the breath of God; or whether
we hold man to be the result of natural selection and survival of the fittest
acting as forces upon some protoplasmic blobs of jelly, we shall never get
beyond conjecture. These questions Professor Hutson has ignored as vain
and profitless. In his volume he has succeeded in condensing and including
more learning, philosophic thought, and curious and significant data
than it has been our fortune to behold these many days. His object is to
take up the prehistoric ages of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Hittites, Ph&oelig;nicians,
Hebrews, Assyrians, Teutons, Etruscans, Hellenes, Kelts, Hindus,
Chinese, Slavs, etc.; and, broad as seems the field, he has not contented
himself with easy and vague generalizations, but by a concise and compact
style, has been able to introduce a great number of data. Small as this
book is, we can hardly trust ourselves to express our sense of its value, lest
we seem to exaggerate.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The School Journal</i>, N. Y. City.</p>

degree of pleasure, and some pride. The fables are good reading&mdash;old and
young will be delighted with them; they are worthy of place by the side of
&AElig;sop&rsquo;s and La Fontaine&rsquo;s; the illustrations are simply superb, true to the
text, supplementing and enforcing the teachings of the author, and true to
art, original, graphic, and charming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the collections of Fables which have
appeared since La Fontaine, that of Florian
is, beyond dispute, the best. It is also, of
all the works of the author, that in which
his talent as a writer and as a poet
shows to the greatest advantage. In regard
to merit of originality, the author avows
himself that he has put under contribution
all his predecessors; &AElig;sop, Pilpay, Gay,
and above all, the Spanish poet Yriarte,
who has furnished him the most pleasing
apologues. It is worthy of remark that in
this kind of literature, whose object is no
less to instruct than to please, Florian has
one advantage over La Fontaine, that of being
in general better adapted to the unaffected
simplicity of childhood.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Grand
Dictionnaire Universel du xixe. Si&egrave;cle.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good of every description prevails in
this collection. You find here some fables
of touching interest, others of a sweet and
playful humor, others of a biting subtilty,
and still others in a loftier strain without
being above that of the fable. The poet
understands how to vary his colors with the
subjects; he can describe and converse, relate
and moralize. We nowhere feel the
effort and are always sensible of the metre.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>La
Harpe.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the writings of Florian we are solely
interested with the meaning of the tale,
with its moral, which is always refined and
delicate, and with his ingenuous and even
epigrammatic style. Florian loves Horace,
Virgil, La Fontaine, is delighted with Montaigne
and the poetic tales of the 16th
century; he notices the caprices and little
irregularities of human nature, without
being a biting critic or a profound moralist.
Under the gentle form of fables he threw
an agreeable breeze of ridicule both upon
the individual and upon society, as if he
hoped to reform.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>M. St. Marc Girardin.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Few readers of French are unacquainted
with the works of Florian. His style,
at once elegant and easy, has universally
recommended him to the teachers of language,
and Telemachus is commonly succeeded
or supplanted by some work of
Florian. In the circulating libraries the
Tales of Florian are almost as generally read
as those of Voltaire and Marmontel. He
possesses indeed very great attractions for
the lovers of light reading. His narrative
is spirited and interesting. Love, Friendship,
and Heroism are his themes, and he
commonly descants upon them with that
genuine warmth which results from the
combination of sensibility with genius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The feelings with him are never exalted
at the expense of virtue. His women are
tender without licentiousness, and his
heroes daring without violating the laws of
their country, or questioning the existence
of their Creator. He combines the morality
of Fenelon with the enthusiasm of Rousseau
or St. Pierre. His writings derive an additional
charm from his glowing descriptions
of the beauties of nature. He seems tenaciously
to uphold the poetical connection
between rural life and moral purity, and
loves to annex to tales of love and hardihood
their appropriate scenery of rivers,
woods, and mountains.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Quarterly
Review.</i></p>

<h3 id="c163">The Unity of the Truth.</h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>The Unity of the Truth in Christianity and Evolution.</b> By J. Max Hark, D.D. 12mo. 293 pages.
Small Pica type, leaded, cloth, gilt top, uncut pages, <i><b>90c.</b></i></dt>
</dl>
<p>Few books of its kind recently published have aroused more discussion
and called forth more varied and contradictory opinions. For example,
<i>The Andover Review</i> gave fifteen pages to a criticism of its positions;
while <i>The Christian Union</i>, of equal authority, declares that &ldquo;The volume
deserves to take rank with the works of Munger, Newman Smyth, and
Prof. Drummond.&rdquo; The N. Y. <i>Independent</i>, though granting that &ldquo;in
many respects the volume is instructive and suggestive,&rdquo; and &ldquo;its aim
merits commendation,&rdquo; has devoted over four columns to combatting its
arguments; whereas the critical <i>Sunday-School Times</i> has heartily commended
it in a leading review. While the <i>Presbyterian Quarterly</i> (S. C.)
condemns it as being &ldquo;of no more use than to show the antagonism of the
human heart to the things of God,&rdquo; the <i>Reformed Review</i> (Pa.) praises it
as &ldquo;an earnest effort towards the solution of a grave and difficult problem,&rdquo;
and says, &ldquo;The author deserves the thanks of all who are sincerely interested
in the progress of religion and in the welfare of the Church.&rdquo; Such contradictions
from such sources are the strongest proof of the importance of
the work, and of the need of every intelligent person&rsquo;s reading and judging
it for himself. At the same time, however, by far the greater weight of
criticism, religious and secular, is favorable to it, as will be seen by the following
few</p>
<p class="center"><b>Critical Comments.</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;A very remarkable book, written in a nervous, brilliant style, each phrase a squarely-planted
and advancing step. That it will bring peace and conviction to many restless
souls cannot be doubted.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The World</i>, N. Y. City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen no volume which seems to us so thorough and intelligent in its purpose
to consider the relations between modern evolutionary thought and ancient Christian faith
and doctrines. Does not attempt to reconcile science and religion by tearing away either
the one or the other.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Christian Union</i>, N. Y. City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good, wholesome book, brief enough for the busiest Christian, an honest untechnical
book, of plain words, and powerful. It is an admirable essay, informed with the essence
of true religion, and destined to bring light to many struggling Christians.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Press</i>,
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He speaks with freshness and enthusiasm. We are persuaded that Dr. Hark&rsquo;s purpose
and spirit are such that good will be wrought by his work.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Illus. Christian Weekly</i>, N.
Y. City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A candid and thoughtful discussion; expounded with much earnestness and a fine
religious spirit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary World</i>, Boston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can hardly fail to help the candid reader to a wider and more satisfactory view of
God, of Providence, of Prayer, and of Religion. Whatever does this for man has proved
an infinite blessing to him.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Evangelist</i>, St. Louis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Significant as showing very clearly the drift of the orthodox creed in the hands of its
intelligent supporters.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Sunday News</i>, Charleston, S. C.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sincere and reverent endeavor to help all inquiring souls, in trouble concerning the
conflict between evolution and the doctrines of Christianity.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Interior</i>, Chicago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No writer could approach any question with a more candid spirit or more honorable
motive. We wish every clergyman could read the work, and every other person indeed
who is interested in the question of evolution.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Herald of Gospel Liberty</i>, Dayton, O.</p>

<h3 id="c164">The Spirit of Beauty.</h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>The Spirit of Beauty.</b> Essays, Scientific and &AElig;sthetic. By Prof. Henry W. Parker. Large 12mo,
cloth, <b>85c.</b>;</dt>
</dl>
<p>&ldquo;I have already read a large part of the book, and I have been delighted,
instructed, and morally animated. It gives rich, delicate, and robust expression
to a various knowledge, as well as to fine, devout and far-reaching
thought. I have not for long taken up a book which has interested me so
immediately, or refreshed me so abundantly.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Rev. R. S. Storrs</span>, D.D.,
Brooklyn, N. Y.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An admirable treatment of a widely related theme. The book is none the less profound
for being so pungent, and its sharp raciness of style is quite befitting its keen discrimination
of thought.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Pres. Julius H. Seelye, LL.D.</span>, Amherst College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I appreciate it highly. The incisive but graceful style is worthy the pure and elevating
sentiments and conceptions which it inculcates. I feel a singular sympathy with its
way of thinking, and shall embrace every proper opportunity to call attention to a book so
brilliant and so noble in its aims.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Prof. Alexander Winchell, LL.D.</span>, Michigan University.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Prof. Parker chiefly by the articles he gave me for the <i>North American Review</i>.
These gave me the highest regard for him as an original, sound and deep thinker. I have
repeatedly characterized his article on the natural theology of art as the best paper that
passed under my hands during the ten or eleven years of my editorship. My belief is that
Mr. Parker&rsquo;s &aelig;sthetic capacity and culture are unsurpassed among us.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Prof. A. P. Peabody,
D.D.</span>, of Harvard University.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prof. Parker, like the late President Hitchcock, was continually laying in rich stores
of facts and principles in the several departments of natural history. At the same time he
was contributing to the <i>North American Review</i> articles in natural and ethical philosophy
unexcelled for richness and beauty by any contemporaneous productions of American
periodical literature.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Prof. W. S. Tyler</span>, LL.D., of Amherst College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By personal knowledge of the manuscript I know that Prof. Parker has investigated
the subjects of Animal Intelligence and Animal &AElig;sthetics in a new and fresh way, as never
has been done before, in defence of a spiritual philosophy. It is a work that was greatly
needed, and is thoroughly done by Dr. Parker, as only an accomplished naturalist, a skilful
literateur and a clear reasoner could do it.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Ex-President G. F. Magoun, D.D.</span>, of
Iowa College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The title is a gem in itself, and I have named my wife after it. I have had a copy
presented to the Philosophical Society of Great Britain, and have urgently recommended
the author for honorary membership, and am assured of success. These deeds are better
encomiums than words like the following:&mdash;that I deem it one of the best displays of the
connection between science and religion I have ever met with. A grand book.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Ephraim
Cutter</span>, M.D., LL.D., Hon. F. S. Sc. (London), Mem. Victoria Inst., etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The author is a naturalist and in quite familiar with the facts and views of Darwin,
Spencer and Haeckel; and, whatever restrictions he may make upon them, he has made as
a man who has studied the subject from the inside. The observation of facts in the organic
and inorganic worlds is good.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Science.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;In Prof. Henry W. Parker&rsquo;s volume we have just one of those protests against the
recent schools of philosophical sensationalism which are sure to be raised, sooner or later,
in the name of esthetics. We welcome everything that will bring intelligent people to see
that it is not dogmatic orthodoxy alone or the limited and perhaps narrow interests of sectarian
religion which are assailed by this philosophy, but the whole spiritual theory of
man, the basis of his esthetic ideas and of art in all its higher relations. This is the value
of Professor Parker&rsquo;s book. It is attractive in style and indicates an abundant familiarity
with the subject, both as a naturalist and a student of esthetics. The chapter on the Divine
in Art can hardly be surpassed in the literature of the subject.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>N. Y. Independent.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Spirit of Beauty</i>, by Prof. Parker, is a fresh find in John B. Alden&rsquo;s literary gold
mine. It is a series of essays, &aelig;sthetic and scientific, inspired by a reverent passion for
purity and beauty, and clothed in the language of a ripe and finished scholar. The essays
are all overflowing with beauty, melody and fragrance, as well as charged with learning
and profound thought.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Southern Criterion</i>, Atlanta, Ga.</p>

<h3 id="c165">The Talmud: What It Is</h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt>and What it Knows about Jesus and his Followers. By Rev. Bernhard Pick, Ph.D.
Ideal Edition, Small Pica type, cloth, <b>60c.</b>;</dt>
</dl>
<p>One of the most interesting and valuable of recent contributions
to religious literature. It answers the great popular curiosity as to what the Talmud
is, and gives to clergymen and theological students information of transcendant value,
not heretofore accessible to many.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wonderful monument of human industry, human wisdom,
and human folly.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Dean Milman.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the history of the origin of Christianity, the Talmud has
hitherto been far too much neglected.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Ernest Renan.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Talmud may compete with the <i>Constitutions of Loyola</i> for
the right to be considered the most irresistible organ ever forged for the subjugation of
the human will.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Review.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Talmud is the slow growth of several centuries. It is a
chaos of Jewish learning, wisdom and folly, a continent of rubbish with hidden pearls
of true maxims and poetic fables.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Philip Schaff.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But glimpses of profound metaphysics, stray parables of real
beauty, and occasional sentiments of true spiritual breadth and elevation, are only the
rare grains of wheat in mountains of chaff.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Dr. Geikie.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything more utterly unhistorical than the Talmud cannot be
conceived. It is probable that no human writings ever confounded names, dates, and
facts with more absolute indifference. Some excellent maxims may be quoted from
the Talmud where they lie imbedded like pearls in a sea of obscurity and mud.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Canon
Farrar.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A most curious monument, raised with astonishing labor, yet
made up of puerilities. An immense heap of rubbish, at the bottom of which a few
bright pearls of Eastern wisdom are to be found. The book composed by Israel <i>without</i>
their God, in the time of their dispersion, their misery, and their degeneracy.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Dr.
Isaac Da Costa.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, then, we find a prodigious mass of contradictory opinions,
an infinite number of casuistical cases, a logic of scholastic theology, some recondite
wisdom, and much rambling dotage; many puerile tales and oriental fancies;
ethics and sophisms, reasonings and unreasonings, subtle solutions, and maxims and
riddles.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Benjamin Disraeli.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a vast debating club in which there hum confusedly the
myriad voices of at least five centuries. In its way, a unique code of laws, in comparison
with which, in point of comprehensiveness, the law books of all other nations
are but Lilliputian, and, when compared with the hum of its kaleidoscopic Babel, they
resemble, indeed, calm and studious retreat.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Prof. Delitzsch.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It has proved a grateful task to wander through the mazes of
the Talmud and cull flowers yet sparkling with the very dew of Eden. Figures in
shining garments haunt its recesses. Prayers of deep devotion, sublime confidence and
noble benediction, echo in its ancient tongue. Sentiments of lofty courage, of high
resolve, of infantile tenderness, of far-seeing prudence, fall from the lips of venerable
sages. No less practicable would it be to stray with an opposite intention, and to
extract venom, instead of honey, from the flowers that seem to spring up in self-sown
profusion. Fierce, intolerant, vindictive hatred for mankind; idle subtlety; pride and
self conceit amounting to insanity; indelicacy pushed to a grossness that renders what
it calls virtue more hateful than the vice of more modest people; all these strung
together would give no more just an idea of the Talmud than would the chaplets of its
lovelier flowers.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Review.</i></p>

<h3 id="c166">A Remarkable Story.</h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>Strange Threads.</b> A Novel. By J. Douglas. 12mo, cloth, <b>60c.</b> (15c); 22 oz</dt>
</dl>
<p>This is not only a remarkable story in itself but is really wonderful in its power to interest
its readers, and in the various ways in which it impresses them. A gentleman whom
the <i>Christian Leader</i>, Cincinnati, calls &ldquo;a wise and critical connossieur&rdquo; pronounces this
book, with the possible exception of Vanity Fair, &ldquo;the most original novel I ever read. * *
I should have to go back as far as &lsquo;Jane Eyre&rsquo; and &lsquo;Villette,&rsquo; to name a novel as good as
&lsquo;Strange Threads,&rsquo; and I am not at all certain that this is not as strong as either of them.&rdquo;
And the <i>Leader</i> calls the book the &ldquo;creation of a master imagination&rdquo; and declares it to
be &ldquo;evidently the product of a genius.&rdquo; The burden of testimony is along this line. Still
there are</p>
<p class="center"><b>A FEW CONTRARY MINDS</b></p>
<p>whose opinions we quote in connection with the favorable criticisms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can conceive that with less effort the author might write a passable book. As to
the present book it is fairly unreadable, and the veriest devourer of romances cannot possibly
get past the opening chapters without the feeling that he is in for a bad time.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily
Bee</i>, Omaha, Neb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The publisher has done more than the writer for this book. The type and paper are
so agreeable that one is tempted to read on, long after the discovery that there is little in
the matter worthy of serious consideration. The author has shown a certain shrewdness,
however, in filling the vacuum produced by absence of intellect in the book by cramming
it with sentiment.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Epoch</i>, N. Y. City.</p>
<p class="center"><b>MAN OR WOMAN?</b></p>
<p>Another matter about which the critics are puzzled is the sex of the author. Some affirm
that J. Douglas is a man, others are equally sure that it is a woman&rsquo;s name, while
some are content to say they do not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;J. Douglas is a new name in our list of novel-writers, but if &lsquo;Strange Threads&rsquo; is
his maiden effort, he is surely a phenomenon. Regarded as the first work of a new
writer, it is simply wonderful; even as the product of mature experience it is still
worthy of being termed remarkable. It is original without being strained or whimsical,
wholesomely terse in construction, frequently bright in epigram, and the story
grows stronger with every page to the close. It is not too much to say that it will
bear reading along with the novels of Charlotte Bronte, and the writer succeeds even
better than she in picturing his characters in life-like presence without making an
elaborate study of them, while there is a more perceptible and worthier motive in his
drawing.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Paper World.</i> Springfield, Mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;J. Douglas is evidently a woman. The adventures of a party of American novelists
in Europe, their love-making and their heart disappointments, are the author&rsquo;s
stock in trade, and she has certainly succeeded in weaving a very tangled web. There
are here and there a strong portraiture and a keen analysis of motives, while the descriptive
portions have a picturesqueness and vigor which give old and well-traveled
roads a new beauty.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Record</i>, Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is probable that &ldquo;J.&rdquo; stands for Jane, Josephine or some other name feminine,
for the book is thoroughly a woman&rsquo;s book. It certainly is very well written, and, if
by a new aspirant for literary honors, as it seems, she is certain to make her mark.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Republic</i>, St. Louis, Mo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new American novelist of considerable originality and force has appeared. The
name is J. Douglas, though whether it stands for man or woman must be gathered
from the book. The dialogue is bright, the situations are dramatic and the book is
thoroughly readable from beginning to end.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Illus. Christian Weekly</i>, N. Y. City.</p>
<p class="center"><b>PRE-EMINENTLY A LOVE STORY.</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;A love Story; a bright sketchy tale of a wayward young lady&mdash;that is, wayward in
her loves. It is certainly very original; on the whole, is a novel to be liked by the
public.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Times</i>, Kansas City, Mo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most interesting work, which engrosses the attention of the reader from the first to
the last chapter.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Call</i>, San Francisco.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h3 id="c167">Lang Syne, or the Wards of Mt. Vernon.</h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>Lang Syne;</b> or The Wards of Mount Vernon. By Mary Stuart Smith. 12mo, paper, <b>30c.</b> (10c)., cloth,
<b>60c.</b> (20c).</dt>
</dl>
<p>In this book, which is dedicated &ldquo;To the Memory of Washington and to American
Womanhood,&rdquo; we have an interesting love story of the revolutionary era, in which are
interwoven in a skilful manner many excellent descriptions of prominent events and of the
eminent men, Washington, Lee, Franklin, Cadwalader, and others, who were foremost in
the great struggle for independence. It also shows the important part taken by the women
of that period and the valuable service which they rendered the patriot army. About one-third
of the book is specially devoted to &ldquo;the Women of the Revolution.&rdquo; A great deal
of information regarding the character, habits, tastes, and labors of the people of that
stirring period is conveyed in an entertaining manner. The author, who styles herself a
&ldquo;Daughter of Virginia&rdquo; (and who might have stated the interesting fact that she is a
direct descendant of Gen. Washington&rsquo;s only sister) has done well to write this book, and
its appearance at this centennial period is appropriate and timely.</p>
<h3 id="c168">Patriotic Hymns.</h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>Rankin. Hymns Pro Patria.</b> By Rev. J. E. Rankin, D.D. Ideal Edition, cloth, <b>60c.</b> (20c).</dt>
</dl>
<p>Dr. Rankin needs no introduction to the American public. As a clergyman and an author
he long ago won high reputation. In this little volume will be found his more recent
poems. They include some of his finest work and will certainly add to his reputation as a
genuine poet. In the collection are Hymns for Forefather&rsquo;s Day. National Hymns, Humanitarian
Hymns, Foreign Missionary Hymns, Christian Endeavor Hymns, and several
Hymns relating to Christian Experience. The book will interest many.</p>
<h3 id="c169">Jerry: A Story for Young Folks.</h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>Pratt. Jerry.</b> By Ellen P. Pratt. 12mo, cloth, <b>75c.</b> (25c).</dt>
</dl>
<p>This is a spirited story which will especially please the young people, though it will
furnish no small degree of entertainment to their elders. It opens sadly with a record of
intemperance and misery, but the scene soon changes and the love story opens in earnest.
Various adventures, some of them quite remarkable, are narrated. The characters are
numerous, events move rapidly, and the interest deepens until the closing page is reached.</p>
<h3 id="c170">The Medical Student <span class="small"><i>As Pictured in Punch.</i></span></h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>Smith. The London Medical Student.</b> By Albert Smith. 12mo, cloth, <b>50c.</b> (20c).</dt>
</dl>
<p>In this book the career of a student in a London Medical College is traced in a broadly
humorous manner. The appearance of the &ldquo;new man&rdquo; when he comes up from the
country to continue his medical studies is aptly described, and the zeal with which he enters
upon his new duties is delineated in a laughable manner. His subsequent course, his dodging
of recitations, the letters home for money with which, ostensibly, to purchase books,
his examination, and the various &ldquo;Curiosities of Medical Experience,&rdquo; follow in a similar
strain. The work is reprinted from <i>Punch</i>, in which it appeared as a serial.</p>
<h3 id="c171">Dorance: A Novel.</h3>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>Nelson. Dorance; A Novel.</b> By R. E. Nelson. 12mo, cloth, <b>75c.</b> (25c).</dt>
</dl>
<p>This first novel by an author as yet unknown to the public will find sympathetic readers
among those who still read Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Virginia blood, but of Northern birth, my earliest sympathies were aroused in behalf
of the people of both races of the &lsquo;Sunny Southland,&rsquo; and my imagination was made
alive by the glowing pictures of Southern life, gleaned from my friends and from books on
the subject. If I have succeeded in interesting my young friends in this phase of life,
which has now passed into history, the problem of which is still unsolved in a measure, I
will have fully accomplished my purpose in writing this book.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Author&rsquo;s Preface.</i></p>

<h2 id="c174"><br />New Catalogue&mdash;<i>Important Change in Terms.</i></h2>
<p>The accompanying catalogue is thoroughly revised to date, and differs from its predecessors
materially in the one point, that the prices given include the <i><b>cost of pre-payment</b></i>
by mail or express&mdash;instead of the New York City <i><b>net prices</b></i>, to which the cost
of postage has been added, heretofore.</p>
<p>The change is principally one of convenience rather than of either reduction or increase,
though on many books there is a substantial reduction in the cost to purchasers, cost of
transportation being taken into account. An allowance of <i><b>8 cents a pound</b></i>, which is
made on bills ordered sent by express or freight, cost of transportation payable on
arrival, by the purchaser, is equivalent to a discount of front <i><b>15 to 30 per cent</b></i>.
from catalogue prices, varying according to quality, style, copyright, and other considerations,
on different books.</p>
<p>The first page of the catalogue fully and clearly sets forth the new terms.</p>
<h2 id="c175"><br />Wanted&mdash;Agents.</h2>
<p>Personally you may not care to go into the &ldquo;Book Agency Business,&rdquo; but possibly you
may know of some good person who will undertake to &ldquo;organize a book club&rdquo; in your
neighborhood, or make a thorough house-to-house canvass of the entire township or county.
<b>A $1.00 Book Free</b> to you (your choice) if you will send me the
address of such a person, who will sell for
me as much as $25 worth of books within two months from time of taking hold. As a
means of making my books better known I want to have at least one sample book put into
every intelligent household; once there they are a permanent advertisement.</p>
<p>A few of my publications are unexcelled, <i><b>for experienced book agents</b></i>, notably</p>
<dl class="detail"><dt><b>Alden&rsquo;s Manifold Cyclopedia.</b></dt>
<dt><b>Alden&rsquo;s Cyclopedia of Universal Literature.</b></dt>
<dt><b>Geikie&rsquo;s Holy Land and the Bible.</b></dt>
<dt><b>The Great Locomotive Chase</b> (the most thrilling and unique story of the war).</dt>
<dt><b>The Woman&rsquo;s Story</b> (by Twenty Famous American Women, Mrs. Stowe, Miss Alcott, and others).</dt>
<dt><b>Alden&rsquo;s Home Atlas</b>, and <b>Handy Atlas</b>,</dt></dl>
<p>and several others which could be named. Please do anything you can to further the interests
of The Literary Revolution, and your kindness will be appreciated by</p>
